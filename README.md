mesh :https://github.com/ranahanocka/point2mesh

and MeshCNN : https://github.com/ranahanocka/MeshCNN

Specifically, **The codes in authors/ folder are codes modified from original code https://github.com/ranahanocka/Point2Mesh/ and https://github.com/ranahanocka/MeshCNN**.


Everything else are implemented ourselves.


4.4. Irreproducible experiments
Some experiments of the original paper [4] were not reproducible due to lack of information or resource constraint.
Experiments of Figure 3, 16, 17 of the original paper did not have enough explanation on the algorithm to reproduce theresults. 
For Figure 11 we didnâ€™t have a scanner nor the datafrom it. 
The table at page 11 was not reproducible as the specific 50 configurations were not provided.
Also, classifying noisy or detailed was done manually by the author which is qualitative and likely to be different from our standard.
